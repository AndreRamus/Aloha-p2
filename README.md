#Project 1 pt-b: Aloha Site
![Aloha Shop Home Page](homepage.png)
Project Aloha pt-2 at RED was an extention of Aloha pt-1. It brought to the table an introduction to jQuery, and the active web.

##About the Aloha Site

The Aloha site is a one page, mobile first "ecommerce" shop for an imaginary company called the Aloha Apparel Co.

###Technology Used
This project was built on top of our first project, Project 1 pt-b, which was a static page. Below are the languages I used to code the website for project hand-in.

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JQuery

* Slick Slider Plugin
- GIT for version control
